            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>Student at KTH Royal Institute of Technology and studying my degree of Master of Science in
                engineering in industrial engineering and management. Work experience include summer jobs at
                a kindergarten, working as a math tutor, and volunteering at a cultural exchange organization. I
                also spent a year abroad in the US during high school which left me with lots of experience and
                knowledge. Therefore, I am very proficient in English and would have no problem speaking
                English at work. My year abroad also helped me develop as a person and I got used to meeting
                lots of different people from different backgrounds. Another thing to add about me is that I have
                a big interest in IT and tech and some programming experience before starting university.</p>
